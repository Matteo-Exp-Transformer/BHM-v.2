### **📁 TIER 2 - REFERENCE (Historical Context)**

These documents provide background but **may be outdated**:

**Archive Folder:**
- `HACCP_Business_Manager_PRD.md` - Original PRD (historical)
- `PLANNING.md` - Original planning (superseded)
- Session reports (historical logs)
- Progress reports (past milestones)

**Root Level (Outdated):**
- `CURRENT_STATUS.md` ❌ Sept 27 - **IGNORE** (claims production ready)
- `PROJECT-ORGANIZATION.md` ⚠️ Jan 23 - Use structure only
- `CURSOR-COORDINATION-MASTER.md` ⚠️ Old coordination (obsolete)

**Bug Reports:**
- `bug-tracking-index.md` ❌ Sept 25 - **IGNORE** (claims all bugs fixed)
- Individual bug reports - Historical reference only

---

### **🚫 TIER 3 - DO NOT USE**

**DANGEROUS - These documents are WRONG:**

1. ❌ `CURRENT_STATUS.md` (Sept 27, 2025)
   - Claims: "PRODUCTION READY"
   - Reality: NOT production ready
   - **DO NOT USE** for decisions

2. ❌ `Bug_Reports/bug-tracking-index.md` (Sept 25, 2025)
   - Claims: "ALL BUGS RESOLVED"
   - Reality: 14 bugs identified
   - **DO NOT USE** for tracking

3. ❌ Any document claiming "100% ready"
   - These are aspirational, not actual
   - Ignore until we achieve true stability
