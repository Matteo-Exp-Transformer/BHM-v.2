# 🔄 MERGE COORDINATION INSTRUCTIONS

**Date:** September 22, 2025
**Situation:** Selective merge required to combine Claude backend + Cursor UI work
**Status:** Ready for execution

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL MERGE SITUATION**

### **Problem Summary:**
- **Claude Branch:** Has 3 major backend milestones (B.7.1, B.7.2, B.7.6) = 20,000+ lines
- **Cursor Branch:** Has excellent UI work (B.7.4, B.7.5) but accidentally deleted Claude's backend
- **Solution:** Selective merge to preserve both teams' work

---

## 📋 **INSTRUCTIONS FOR USER/CURSOR**

### **Step 1: Backup Current Cursor Work**
```bash
# In Cursor worktree, backup current work
git checkout Curs
git branch Curs-Backup-PreMerge
git log --oneline -10  # Note latest commits
```

### **Step 2: Pull Claude's Integrated Branch**
```bash
# Claude has already integrated Cursor's UI components
git fetch origin
git checkout Claude  # Switch to Claude's branch
git pull origin Claude
```

### **Step 3: Verify Integration**
```bash
# Check that both teams' work is present:
ls src/services/offline/     # Should show Claude's offline system
ls src/services/export/      # Should show Claude's export system
ls src/services/realtime/    # Should show Claude's real-time system
ls src/components/ui/        # Should show Cursor's UI components
ls src/styles/accessibility.css  # Should show Cursor's accessibility work
```

### **Step 4: Continue Development**
- ✅ **All Cursor UI work preserved** (Button, Modal, accessibility)
- ✅ **All Claude backend work preserved** (offline, export, real-time)
- ✅ **TypeScript errors resolved** (thanks to Cursor)
- ✅ **Ready for B.7.3 Mobile PWA Enhancement**
