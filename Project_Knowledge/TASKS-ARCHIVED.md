# 📋 HACCP Business Manager - Archived Development Tasks

**Version:** 1.2 (Archived)
**Archived Date:** January 22, 2025
**Source:** Extracted from TASKS.md v1.2 - Foundation milestones and completed work
**Purpose:** Historical record of completed development phases

## 🎯 **PROJECT OVERVIEW (HISTORICAL)**

HACCP Business Manager is a Progressive Web App (PWA) for digitalizing food safety management in restaurants. The development was organized using a **dual-AI workflow** with **Claude** (complex architecture & business logic) and **Cursor** (UI/UX implementation & CRUD operations) working in synchronized worktrees.

### **🔀 DUAL WORKTREE STRUCTURE**
