# üß™ GEMINI FIRST TEST - B.10.3 MERGE COORDINATION

**Test Purpose:** Validate Gemini's ability to handle complex merge coordination following Claude's standards
**Expected Duration:** 30-45 minutes
**Success Criteria:** Seamless continuation of Claude's work with identical quality

---

## üéØ **TEST SCENARIO**

### **Current Situation:**
Claude has just completed B.10.3 Enterprise Automation and successfully merged it to the main branch in the Claude worktree. However, other worktrees need coordination to receive these updates.

### **Your Mission:**
Demonstrate that you can handle complex project coordination exactly as Claude would, maintaining the same technical rigor and decision-making quality.

---

## üìã **STEP-BY-STEP TEST TASKS**

### **Phase 1: Environment Assessment (10 min)**

**1.1 Verify Your Setup:**
```bash
# Confirm you're in the correct worktree
pwd
git branch
git status
```

**1.2 Analyze Current Repository State:**
- Check all 4 worktree statuses
- Identify which worktrees have B.10.3 automation
- Determine synchronization gaps
- Review recent commit history across worktrees

**1.3 Documentation Review:**
- Read GEMINI-RULES.md thoroughly (this validates your understanding)
- Review B.10.3 completion documentation
- Check current coordination status

**Expected Output:** Clear assessment of current multi-worktree state

### **Phase 2: Strategic Planning (10 min)**

**2.1 Create Merge Strategy:**
- Plan how to propagate B.10.3 to other worktrees
- Identify potential conflicts and resolutions
- Determine optimal merge sequence
- Consider impact on Cursor's upcoming B.10.4 work

**2.2 Risk Assessment:**
- Identify what could go wrong during merges
- Plan mitigation strategies
- Determine rollback procedures if needed

**Expected Output:** Comprehensive merge plan with risk mitigation

### **Phase 3: Execution (15 min)**

**3.1 Execute Merge Coordination:**
- Sync necessary worktrees with B.10.3 automation
- Handle any merge conflicts that arise
- Validate automation systems work in target worktrees
- Test that B.10.3 functionality is preserved

**3.2 Integration Validation:**
- Run automation tests in affected worktrees
- Verify performance benchmarks are maintained
- Confirm API availability for B.10.4 development

**Expected Output:** All worktrees properly synchronized with working automation

### **Phase 4: Documentation & Handoff (10 min)**

**4.1 Update Coordination Files:**
- Update CURSOR-COORDINATION-MASTER.md with current status
- Ensure B.10.4 specifications are accessible to Cursor
- Document any changes or decisions made during merge

**4.2 Prepare Handoff:**
- Create clear status update for when Claude returns
- Document any issues encountered and solutions applied
- Ensure project continuity is maintained

**Expected Output:** Complete documentation of changes and status

---

## üö® **EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS**

### **If You Get Stuck:**
1. **Document the Issue:** Clearly explain what's blocking you
2. **Assess Impact:** Determine if this blocks other team members
3. **Implement Safe Fallback:** Revert to last known good state if needed
4. **Flag for Review:** Mark issue for future resolution
5. **Communicate Status:** Update coordination files with current state

### **If Something Breaks:**
1. **Immediate Assessment:** Identify scope of the problem
2. **Isolate Impact:** Prevent spread to other systems
3. **Restore Function:** Get back to working state quickly
4. **Document Incident:** Explain what happened and why
5. **Plan Prevention:** How to avoid this in future
