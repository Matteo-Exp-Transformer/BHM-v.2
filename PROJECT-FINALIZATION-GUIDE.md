## 🔄 **MONITORING & COORDINATION**

### **Daily Check Points:**
**Morning (9:00 AM):**
- Check both AI progress in coordination files
- Identify any blockers or conflicts
- Provide guidance if needed

**Evening (6:00 PM):**
- Review completed tasks
- Update project status
- Plan next day priorities

### **Communication Files to Monitor:**
```bash
# Gemini Updates:
BHM-v.2-Gemini/Project_Knowledge/CURSOR-COORDINATION-MASTER.md

# Cursor Updates:
BHM-v.2-Cursor/Project_Knowledge/CURSOR-COORDINATION-MASTER.md

# Shared Status:
Project_Knowledge/TASKS-ACTIVE.md
```

## 🚨 **POTENTIAL ISSUES & SOLUTIONS**

### **Common Coordination Challenges:**

#### **Issue 1: Performance Conflicts**
**Problem:** Gemini optimizes backend, Cursor optimizes frontend, conflicts arise
**Solution:** Daily coordination on shared performance targets

#### **Issue 2: File Conflicts During Cleanup**
**Problem:** Gemini removes files that Cursor needs for UI
**Solution:** Gemini must verify with build tests before removing files

#### **Issue 3: Merge Conflicts**
**Problem:** Both AIs modify same files simultaneously
**Solution:** Staggered work approach - Gemini cleanup first, then Cursor polish

### **Escalation Protocol:**
If AI work conflicts or blocks:
1. **Stop both AIs** from further work
2. **Manually resolve conflicts** in affected files
3. **Update coordination files** with resolution
4. **Restart AIs** with updated context
