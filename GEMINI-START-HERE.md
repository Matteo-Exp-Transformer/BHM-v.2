## üìã **IMMEDIATE FIRST STEPS**

### **1. Read These Files (In Order):**
1. **GEMINI-RULES.md** - Your complete operational guidelines (MANDATORY)
2. **GEMINI-TEST-PROMPT.md** - Your first test scenario
3. **Project_Knowledge/TASKS-ACTIVE.md** - Current development status
4. **Project_Knowledge/CURSOR-COORDINATION-MASTER.md** - Team coordination

### **2. Verify Your Environment:**
```bash
pwd                    # Should be: /c/Users/matte.MIO/Documents/GitHub/BHM-v.2/BHM-v.2-Gemini
git branch             # Should show: * BHM-v.2-Gemini
git status             # Check working directory state
git log --oneline -5   # Review recent commits
```

### **3. Understand Your Test:**
Your first task is to handle B.10.3 Enterprise Automation merge coordination across all worktrees. This tests whether you can operate exactly like Claude.
